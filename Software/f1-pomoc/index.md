# Welcome to DA-HelpCreator

ElTexto helps you creating web sites, documentations and online helps in no time

## Creating Pages

On the left hand side you can see the project tree. In this view, you can create pages and sub pages. You must only take care of the content of each page. Creation of the HTML web site and linking of the pages is done for you by DA-HelpCreator. 

With macro functions, you can create elements automatically. For example a sitemap:

<!--sitemap-->

Or the current date:

<!--date-->

## Export

Export the project to Windows Help format or as an HTML Web page. With the FTP Upload you can upload the HTML pages to your webspace with one click.
